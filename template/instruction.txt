You are asked to come up with a set of 20 diverse task instructions and their answers. These instructions will be given to large
language model and we will evaluate it for completing the instructions.
Here are the requirements:
1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.
2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions
with imperative instructions.
3. The type of instructions should be diverse. The list should include diverse types of tasks like open-ended
generation, classification, math reasoning, code generation, world common knowledge, reading comprehension, editing, etc.
2. A language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to
create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set
a reminder because it cannot perform any action.
3. The instructions should be in English.
4. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.
5. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction. It should contain a specific example for the
instruction when needed.
6. Most of the instructions do not require input. In this case, you must simply put "None" in the input field.
7. The input should not be the answer to the instruction. For example, if the instruction is "Write a headline
for ...", the input should not be the said headline. Instead, the input should be "None".
8. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input. Make sure the output is
less than 100 words.
9. Do not repeat instructions.
10. Use [[, ]] to flag the start and end of each example.

Examples of generating 3 task instruction and its answer:

[[Instruction: Give a detailed description of a method for brainstorming an essay.
Input:
Answer: Mind Mapping is one of the methods for brainstorming an essay. Students who are visual learners
may find mind mapping extremely helpful. In order to Mind Mapping:
Take a paper and draw a circle in the center Write your topic inside it. Just like we sketch rays protruding
from a sun, draw lines coming out of the circle. Write an argument or a statement related to the topic at the
end of each line. Draw another set of lines projecting from these statements and state examples that support
them. Continue this exercise until you run out of all possibilities imaginable for this topic.]]

[[Instruction: Write a creative or imaginative response to the given prompt.
Input: You are a time traveler who has just arrived in ancient Egypt. What do you see?
Answer: Wow! As I step out of my time machine, I’m surrounded by towering pyramids and the warm sun
beats down on my face. I see Pharaohs riding in grand chariots, and workers building majestic temples. It’s
like something out of a dream!]]

[[Instruction: Solve a math problem.
Input: A snail is at the bottom of a 20-foot well. Each day, it climbs up 3 feet, but at night, it slips back 2
feet. How many days will it take for the snail to reach the top of the well?
Answer: To solve this problem, we first calculate the net distance the snail covers each day: 3 feet up minus 2 feet down, 
resulting in 1 foot of progress daily. Since the well is 20 feet deep, we can set up the equation: number of days × 1 foot = 20 feet. 
Solving this, we find it takes 20 days for the snail to reach the top. We can verify this by noting that after 19 days, the snail will 
have climbed 19 feet. On the 20th day, it will climb the final 3 feet, reaching the top before any night-time slipping occurs. 
Therefore, the snail will reach the top of the well in 20 days.]]
